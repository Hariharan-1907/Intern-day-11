# Learning List Types in Footer - Day 11

## Overview
On Day 11, I explored different types of lists in HTML and applied them to the footer section of my website. This helped improve content organization and readability.

## List Types Used
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`)** - For general navigation links  
- **Ordered List (`<ol>`)** - For step-by-step instructions or ranking items  
- **Description List (`<dl>`)** - For definitions and additional details  

## Features
- Improved footer structure using lists  
- Better organization of links and content  
- Enhanced readability and user experience  

## Future Enhancements
- Styling lists using CSS for better UI  
- Adding icons to list items for visual appeal  
- Using JavaScript to make lists dynamic  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
